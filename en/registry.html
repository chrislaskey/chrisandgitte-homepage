        <p>Family and Friends, the best gift you can give is supporting our marriage by joining us for our wedding ceremony and celebration. Please do not feel compelled to buy gifts.</p>

        <p>We are so excited to spend our day with you all!</p>

        <h2>But if we can't convince you otherwise...</h2>

        <p>We are saving up for a down payment on a home of our own and would appreciate monetary contributions.</p>

        <p>If you'd prefer a more tangible gift we are registered at <a class="external" href="http://www.crateandbarrel.com/Gift-Registry/Gitte-Venicx-and-Chris-Laskey/r5017064">Crate&amp;Barrel</a> and <a class="external" href="http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/regGiftRegistry.asp?wrn=-616402231&">Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</a>.</p>
